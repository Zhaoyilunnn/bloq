//! Execute a whole compiled [`Bloq`] program without adding noise on the shared
//! [`Simulator`] engine. This is the *one* walk that owns SEM-ORD ordering,
//! region control flow, and measurement-record binding; [`run_bloq`],
//! [`run_bloq_with_hook`], and [`run_bloq_with_io`] are its entry points. (The
//! single-template runner lives with the verifier in [`crate::verify`].)
//!
//! # Whole-program model (`run_bloq`)
//!
//! Measurement ids are allocated contiguously across every instance measurement
//! at every nesting level (`InstanceMeasurement{instance, measurement}` → global
//! id). Nodes are executed in `deterministic_emit_order` onto ONE shared
//! [`Simulator`] over the program's global coordinate layout; a quantum
//! node's circuit comes from `emission_plan` (instances offset-translated), with
//! its local measurement ids remapped to the global ids.
//!
//! ## Region control flow (dynamic, per-shot — the point of a procedural engine)
//!
//! Region bodies are nested [`SubGraph`](bloq_ir::SubGraph)s over the same
//! template pool; the walk recurses into them on the same shared simulator:
//! * `RepeatUntilSuccess` — execute sandboxed body attempts until both the
//!   post-selection restart parities and the IR restart predicate accept, up to
//!   [`DEFAULT_RUS_ATTEMPT_CAP`] attempts. Rejected attempts restore the
//!   pre-body simulator and records (SEM-ATTEMPT); the accepted attempt alone
//!   composes upward.
//!
//! Quantum membership guards select active instances and their record aliases;
//! activation slots suppress inactive classical recipes and region bodies.
//! Classical nodes fold as in a flat program (observable recipes/linear `Compute`;
//! `Discard` rejects the shot and stops its execution). An `Observable` is a
//! complete corrected-parity producer, folding local records and bit-carrying
//! inputs. This no-op executor uses a zero decoder flip; composition
//! therefore has the same bit here. Boundaries contribute only to reports.
//! The per-shot `ObservableReport` is measured on the final state
//! ([`Program::observable_value`]) — the record/feedback fold plus any
//! composed boundary-Pauli face. Detectors (template-local + node
//! instance-space, at every level) are verified per shot with the usual
//! `LoopState`/`RepeatBody` policy.
//!
//! # Observable contract
//!
//! An `Observable` is its raw record parity plus live `Output`-face boundary
//! Paulis. Feedforward byproducts therefore remain visible; callers combine the
//! raw value with the terminal frame sign when they need a deterministic logical
//! value. `Input` faces are source endpoints already closed by composition and
//! are not folded. Because output faces are read from the terminal simulator
//! state, preparation rejects a later quantum node that consumes one.
