//! Execute compiled [`Bloq`](bloq_ir::Bloq) programs.
//!
//! [`run_bloq`] and its variants retain the noiseless physical-verification
//! path. [`lower()`] produces the backend-independent [`Instruction`] stream
//! consumed by [`runtime`], which adds dynamic timing, noise, retries, waits,
//! idling, and mock streaming-decoder decisions.
//!
//! ```
//! use bloq_compile::compile;
//! use bloq_graph::GalleryItem;
//! use bloq_vm::{LoweringConfig, lower};
//!
//! let ir = compile(&GalleryItem::CNOT.build(), 3)?;
//! let options = LoweringConfig::default();
//! let program = lower(&ir, &options)?;
//! let result = program.run(options.runtime_config(42))?;
//! assert!(!result.artifact.discarded);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Physical verification executes compiled circuits, independently of
//! `bloq_graph`'s logical QuiZX verifier. It supports non-Clifford programs;
//! Clifford circuits can also be checked with Stim.
//!
//! The physical verifier adds no noise and assumes zero decoder flips. It still
//! executes explicit noise instructions already present in a circuit. Its
//! IR-mandated retries are bounded by [`DEFAULT_RUS_ATTEMPT_CAP`]. The dynamic
//! runtime uses [`decoder`] instead.
//!
//! [`CircuitExecutor`] is the flat counterpart for a single
//! [`CoordCircuit`](bloq_ir::circuit::CoordCircuit); [`ShotRecord`] is the
//! per-shot measurement outcome map both paths produce.
//!
//! ## Where items live
//!
//! The crate root carries what it takes to *drive* the VM: [`lower()`] and its
//! configuration, [`run()`] and its configuration, the [`run_bloq`] family, the
//! [`Program`] they exchange, and the error types. The public modules carry the
//! full *vocabularies* a consumer reads results back with, which are too large
//! to flatten into one root namespace:
//!
//! - [`instruction`] — the whole lowered ISA ([`Task`](instruction::Task),
//!   [`QuantumOp`](instruction::QuantumOp), [`BoolOp`](instruction::BoolOp),
//!   [`MemoryCycle`](instruction::MemoryCycle), …).
//! - [`runtime`] — the execution trace vocabulary
//!   ([`ExecutionEvent`](runtime::ExecutionEvent),
//!   [`MeasurementRecord`](runtime::MeasurementRecord),
//!   [`WaitReason`](runtime::WaitReason), …) behind an [`ExecutionArtifact`].
//! - [`decoder`] — the mock streaming-decoder policy model.
//! - [`verify`] — the physical verifier's report and expectation readouts.
//!
//! The names that appear in root signatures are re-exported at the root as
//! well, so those have two paths on purpose: a signature stays nameable
//! without reaching into a module. From [`instruction`] that is
//! [`Program`], [`Instruction`], [`SourceRole`], [`SourceSchedule`],
//! [`TaskOrigin`], [`TaskFunction`], and [`DEFAULT_DECODER_LATENCY_ROUNDS`];
//! from [`runtime`] it is [`run`], [`RunResult`], [`RunMetadata`],
//! [`RuntimeConfig`], [`RuntimeLimits`], [`RuntimeError`],
//! [`ExecutionArtifact`], [`LogicalInputState`], and [`TaskMetadata`].
//! Prefer the root path for those; reach into the module for the rest of the
//! vocabulary. Everything in the private modules has exactly one path.
//!
//! The engine (`ticit`) vocabulary is re-exported at the root only, under
//! `Engine`-prefixed aliases where its names would otherwise collide with this
//! crate's own ([`EnginePauli`] against [`instruction::Pauli`],
//! [`EngineInstruction`] against [`Instruction`]).
